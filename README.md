## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client && npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd ../server && npm install
```

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Run both client and server concurrently
npm run dev

# Or run separately:
# Terminal 1 - Start server
npm run server

# Terminal 2 - Start client
npm run client
```

The client runs on `http://localhost:5173` and server on `http://localhost:3001`.

## 📚 How to Use

### Creating and Managing Files

#### 1. Create a New File
- Click the **➕📄** button in the File Explorer
- Enter a filename (e.g., `app.js`, `index.html`, `script.py`)
- The file is created and automatically saved on the server
- All users in the group can see and access the file immediately

#### 2. Create a Folder
- Click the **➕📁** button in the File Explorer
- Enter a folder name (e.g., `src`, `components`, `utils`)
- Organize your files using folders for better structure

#### 3. Open and Edit Files
- Click any file in the File Explorer to open it
- Edit the code in the Monaco editor
- Press **Ctrl+S** (or Cmd+S on Mac) to save changes
- Changes are saved to the server and synced to all users

#### 4. Delete Files/Folders
- Right-click on any file or folder
- Select "Delete" from the context menu
- The file/folder is removed for everyone in the group

### Collaborative Editing

1. **Create or Join a Group**
   - Enter your name on the home screen
   - Create a new group or enter an existing group ID
   - Share the group ID with your collaborators

2. **Work Together**
   - All users see the same file structure
   - Create files and folders that everyone can access
   - Edit files simultaneously with real-time sync
   - Run code and see output together

3. **File Persistence**
   - All files are automatically saved on the server
   - Files remain available even after everyone leaves
   - Return to the same group later to access your files
   - Each group has its own isolated workspace

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Team members join group "project-abc"
# User A creates folder structure:
src/
├── index.js
├── components/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   └── Header.jsx
└── utils/
    └── helpers.js

# User B can immediately see and edit all files
# User C joins later and has access to everything
# All saves go to server/workspace/project-abc/
```

## 🚢 Production Build

```bash
# Build client for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Server (.env)

```env
PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Client (.env)

1. **Create a Group**: Enter your name and click "Create New Group"
2. **Share Link**: Copy and share the group link with collaborators
3. **Join Group**: Others can join using the group ID
4. **Browse Files**: Use the file explorer on the left to navigate
5. **Create Files**: Click ➕📄 to create new files or ➕📁 for folders
6. **Open Files**: Click any file in the explorer to open it
7. **Edit Code**: All changes sync in real-time with collaborators
8. **Save Files**: Press Ctrl+S or click Save button (changes tracked with *)
9. **Change Language**: Select from 12+ programming languages
10. **Run Code**: Click "Run" button or press Ctrl+Enter to execute code

## 📂 Workspace Structure

The editor creates a workspace folder with:

```
workspace/
├── src/          # Source code files
├── tests/        # Test files
└── docs/         # Documentation
```

All files are isolated per session and stored in the server's workspace directory.

## 💻 Compiler Prerequisites

To use the code execution feature, ensure you have the following installed:

- **JDK** (for Java code)
- **GCC/G++** (for C/C++ code)
- **Go** (for Go code)
- **TypeScript** (`ts-node` for TypeScript)

If a language compiler/interpreter is not installed, execution for that language will fail with an appropriate error message.

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation on network issues
- Error notifications for failed operations
